## A planned devops roadmap

# This roadmap will focus on getting started, getting the most important tools to do what they are primarily meant to do. and I will highlight potential projects i will do as well, their progress and the challenges I faced.

# Tools
# Every tool has a reason its included and the reason will be highlighted here

1. Programming language (Python) - A programming language will be used to write automation scripts. I've picked python because its simple and readable (amazing syntax) and versatile. It supports multiple programming paradigms i.e procedural, object oriented and functional. The clean syntax allows for rapid programming and prototyping.  Python is rich in built in functionalities that will make my work easier and it is cross platform compatible it will ensure code portability. Its currently on 12/05/2025  at 12:59 pm the most popular programming language.

2. Operating System - Linux (Ubuntu). Easy to use, It's what I have started with and it's widely used with servers.

3. Terminal Knowledge - Bash (Bourne again shell), its widley used, especially on Linux. Key focus areas will be the Linux system administration course i did. I will mnetion them one by one here.

4. Version Control Systems - Git. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, maintaining a complete history of modifications. Git features local repositories on each developer's machine, enabling offline work and fast operations. It supports non-linear development through branching and merging, facilitating parallel work streams. Git's distributed nature enhances collaboration, backup, and experimentation.

5. Repo Hosting Service - Github. 

6. Containers - Docker. Widely used.

7. Setting up key server utilities (Nginx Can act as a load balancer, caching server and a reverse proxy.) 

   - A Load Balancer, which sits in front of your servers and routing client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests in a manner that maximizes speed and capacity utilization and ensures that no one server is overworked.

   - A caching server, also known as a proxy server or cache server, is a dedicated network server that saves web pages and other Internet content locally to reduce bandwidth usage, server load, and perceived lag. It works by intercepting requests from clients, saving the responses from web servers, and serving cached content to subsequent requests for the same information.

   - A reverse proxy is a server that sits between client devices and backend servers, intercepting requests from clients and forwarding them to appropriate backend servers. It acts on behalf of the servers, providing benefits such as load balancing, caching, SSL termination, and security. Reverse proxies can distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and reliability, cache frequently requested content to reduce server load, handle SSL encryption and decryption to offload this task from backend servers, and provide an additional layer of security by hiding server details.

8. Cloud Providers - AWS/GCP, GCP is because there it is being used at where i currently work (CIFOR-ICRAF). I will use AWS for most of my learning. Here is the cloud roadmap:

9. Provisioning - Refers to the process of setting up and configuring the necessary IT infrastructure to support an application or service. This approach enables consistent, repeatable deployments across different environments, reduces human error, and facilitates rapid scaling and disaster recovery.

10. Configuration Management - Ansible, Configuration management is a systems engineering process for establishing consistency of a productâ€™s/system's attributes throughout its life. It simplifies the process of managing and orchestrating infrastructure by using a declarative language to define desired states and configurations. It employs an agentless architecture, meaning it uses SSH or other remote protocols to execute tasks on target machines without requiring additional software to be installed. Ansible is widely used for automating repetitive tasks, ensuring consistency, and managing large-scale deployments across various environments.

11. CI/CD 
    - Github Actions. The platform provides a marketplace of pre-built actions and supports custom actions. GitHub Actions offers matrix builds, parallel job execution, and supports multiple operating systems and languages. It integrates seamlessly with GitHub's ecosystem, facilitating automated code review, issue tracking, and project management.

12. Secret Management - (Vault) Secret management refers to the secure handling, storage, and distribution of sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and certificates within an organization's IT infrastructure. Vault provides centralized secrets management, access control, and auditing features. Vault supports various authentication methods and dynamic secrets, allowing it to generate secrets on-the-fly and manage their lifecycle. It also offers robust encryption capabilities, both for data at rest and in transit.

13. Infrastructure Monitoring - Prometheus, Node exporter, grafana.

14. Logs Management - Elasticsearch (a distributed search and analytics engine), Logstash (a data processing pipeline),

15. Container Orchestration - Kubernetes
