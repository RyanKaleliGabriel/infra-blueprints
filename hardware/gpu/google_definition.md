## What is a GPU and its role in AI?

Behind this AI revolution is an important piece of hardware: the Graphics Processing Unit or GPU. 
Originally created for graphics rendering (Graphics rendering is the process of generating images or videos from 2D or 3D models using computer software.), GPUs have become increasingly important for AI, enabling the training and deployment of complex AI models that were once impossible to imagine. 

# What is a GPU?
A GPU, short for Graphics Processing Unit, is a specialized electronic circuit originally designed to speed up the creation of images and videos. 
However, its remarkable ability to perform vast numbers of calculations rapidly has led to its adoption in diverse fields, including artificial intelligence and scientific computing, where it excels at handling data-intensive and computationally demanding tasks.

GPUs are built upon a silicon wafer, a thin, circular slice of highly purified silicon. This wafer serves as the base upon which billions of microscopic transistors are etched.
These transistors act as miniature gates controlling the flow of electricity, forming the building blocks of the GPU's logic circuits. A complex network of microscopic metal wires, called interconnects, link these transistors, enabling them to communicate and perform calculations

Finally, the entire assembly is encased in a protective package made of materials like plastic, ceramic, and metal to protect the delicate circuitry and help dissipate heat generated during operation.
